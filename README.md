# Nicholas Preziosi Portfolio Site

My portfolio site showcases my most recent projects/work and is updated frequently! The static site utilizes Tailwind CSS in addition to raw HTML, CSS, and Javascript to provide a sleek, responsive design. I gained a solid understanding of Tailwind by using it in this project.
